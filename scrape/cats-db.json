Tonga was neutered and sold as a pet. A noted geneticist at Georgia University, Dr. Clyde Keeler, wanted to see a domestic cat that mimicked wild species that were becoming extinct. At his request, the breeding of Tonga\u2019s parents was repeated, producing another spotted male, Dalai Dotson, who became the father of the Ocicat breed."
